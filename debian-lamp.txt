====== Debian as a LAMP server ======

We are going to install a new web server that is supposed to serve HTTP traffic for example.com domain.

===== Installation =====

Download Debian Lenny Tiny CD from http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst and burn the image to a compact disk, or mount it as a CD image in your virtualisation software.

Boot your computer and select Install, after that you only need to choose your Language, Country and Keymap you want to use. If your computer is not connected to a network with DHCP you will be prompted to enter network connection parameters manually. After configuring your network and DNS server you will be asked for a hostname, in our case, the hostname is **example** (replace with your domain) and our domain name is **.com**.

When prompted to select Debian mirror the selected choice is usually the best one. If your are not using HTTP proxy on your internet connection, or don't know what HTTP proxy is, just leave this field blank.

When prompted to partition the disk for are Debian install, choose Guided - use entire disk. Install all files in one partition.

Grab a cup of coffee and wait until installation finishes fetching packages from the internet and installs the base system.

Enter your root password. This is a password for root user who has all the privileges on the system, so choose one carefully. After that, you have to create a new user for the system.

You will be asked if you want to participate in the Debians popularity contest which collects information about most used packages. Feel free to answer whatever you like, by choosing Yes you are helping the Debian community to find the most used packages in the distribution. Help them out, it doesn't cost you a thing.

When prompted to select collections of software packages deselect everrything. We just need to install the base system because we will add all needed packages when and if we need them.

Since Debian will be the only system on our machine we have to select to install GRUB on to the master boot record.

Your Debian system is almost ready to go. When asked, remove the installation media from your drive (or unmount the image in your virtualisation software) and reboot your computer.

When your computer boots up you can log in with the root user account and update the packages in your system running:

  apt-get update
  apt-get upgrade

And that is it. Your new Debian is installed and ready for configuration. It took me around 10 to 15 minutes from start to finish.

==== Essential software ====

Since we opted for a bare bones system we are going to install some utility packages and an SSH server so we can connect to our server using [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/|Putty]], or a *nix shell.

  apt-get install ssh wget nano

===== Securing your server (IPTABLES) =====

We are going to secure our web server using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables|iptables]] as a firewall.

  apt-get install iptables

If you check iptables rules with ''iptables -L'' you should see a clean chain list:

  example:~# iptables -L
  Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
  target     prot opt source               destination
  
  Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
  target     prot opt source               destination
  
  Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
  target     prot opt source               destination

To help us set up iptables rules we are going to use a modified version of a firewall script that is used for setting up QmailToaster on CentOS, the script looks like this:

There are two important things your have to do. First replace the MY_IP with the IP address of your server. I am also using the ROUTER variable to configure the IP address that can bypass firewall rules because I wan to have access to everything when I am in my network. My network is behind a NAT so the ROUTER IP is the IP address that the server sees when I connect to the server from within my company. I am using this because I do not want to open up SSH access to my server from the internet.

The script is very well documented and you just have to comment out the services you want to make accessible from the internet. In this case we are only opening up port 80 which is used for incoming connections to our Apache web server and we also tell iptables to respond to ICMP echo requests so we can use ''ping'' to establish if our server is alive.

If you don't have a "safe" IP address to allow access to your machine make sure you un-comment the rule for SSH (port 22), or you will not be able to connect to the machine using SSH. If that is the case, open up ''/etc/ssh/sshd_config'' and change Port from 22 to something else, and make sure you update the new port number in the firewall script. You can also consider some other techniques to secure your box (port knocking) but they are out of the scope of this article.

Copy the script to /root/firewall.sh , cd into the /root directory and run

  sh ./firewall.sh

In case you don't get your prompt back, you did something wrong. Connect to the server, reboot it and try again.

You can now check your rules by using ''iptables -L -n'' and they should not be empty anymore.

The problem is, that if you reboot your server now, all of the rules would be lost, so we have to make sure they are applied whenever our server is rebooted.

The script populated the rules, but it also created a file called iptables.rules in our /root directory.

We are going to copy this file to the /etc/network folder.

  cp /root/iptables.rules /etc/network/

Now we need to edit the /etc/network/interfaces file. Use nano to open it and add

  pre-up iptables-restore < /etc/network/iptables.rules

after the configuration options for your network interface. This line will make sure that before network interface is initialized the rules will be loaded into iptables.

Reboot your server with

  reboot

and when it comes up again log in and check your iptables rules againg with ''iptables -L -n''. They should not be empty, if they are, you are doing something wrong.

===== LAMP =====
==== MySQL ====

To install MySQL enter

  apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client


===== Configuring NTP =====

To make sure our servers time is always up to date we are going to install ntp package which enables our server to use NTP protocol for syncing your servers clock.

  apt-get install ntp

If your data center, or VPS provider offers an NTP server it is wise to use their NTP server. Open up /etc/ntp.conf with nano and replace:

  server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic

with

  server ADDRESS-OF-NTP-SERVER-YOU-WANT-TO-USE

After saving the changes you have to restart the NTP service by running

  invoke-rc.d ntp restart

''invoke-rc.d'' is Debians shortcut to /etc/init.d/. You can run ''/etc/init.d/ntp restart'' as well.

You can examine if the NTP server is working as expected if you run the ''ntpq -p'' command:

example:~# ntpq -p
       remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
   ==============================================================================
   zg1.ntp.CARNet. 161.53.1.2       2 u   58   64    3    7.157  106.619   4.158
   zg2.ntp.CARNet. 161.53.1.2       2 u   57   64    3    7.677   25.934   4.792
   morcic.RI.CARNe 161.53.1.2       2 u   58   64    3   11.796   26.527   7.751

After a while the **reach** column should have values greather that 0. Which means that the NTP servers we are pooling for time information are reachable.

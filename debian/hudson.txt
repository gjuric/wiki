====== Hudson on Debian Lenny ======

===== Hudson & Java installation =====


Hudson is written in Java so we will need to install Java, and to make things simpler we will install Hudson from its reporitory.

Edit ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' and append every line that ends with "lenny mail" with " contrib non-free" and at the end of the file add this line

  deb http://hudson-ci.org/debian binary/

This is needed because Java is not in Debians main repository. Your sources.list should look something like this

  # deb http://ftp.hr.debian.org/debian/ lenny main
  
  deb http://ftp.hr.debian.org/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://ftp.hr.debian.org/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free   

  deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main contrib non-free
  
  deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main contrib non-free
  
  deb http://hudson-ci.org/debian binary/

Update apt information

  apt-get update

To install Java, Hudson and Ant (you do not need Ant if you plan to use Phing for building your project)

  apt-get install sun-java5-jdk hudson ant

To start Hudson after installation enter

  /etc/init.d/hudson start

Hudson should now be available through your browser at http://you-ip-address:8080 

===== Building PHP projects with Hudson =====

Once on Hudsons front page select **Manage Hudson** and then **Manage Plugins** and install this plugins:

* Hudson Clover plugin
* Hudson Checkstyle Plug-in
* Hudson PMD Plug-in
* Hudson Phing plugin (if you are using Phing)

Return to the Manage Hudson page and select **Configure System**. If you are using Ant, select **Add Ant**, uncheck "Install automatically" and under name enter "Ant 1.7.0" and for ANT_HOME enter ''/usr/share/ant'' . 

You can also enter settings for E-mail notifications.

===== PHP code metrics =====

Running automatic unit tests is probably the main reason for having a continuous integration server so lets install PHPUnit.

First make sure you have pear installed

  apt-get install php-pear

To get the latest version of PHPUnit we will have to update our pear installer as well.

  pear upgrade pear
  pear channel-update pear.php.net
  pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
  pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

Why we are at it, let's install some other useful tools for code metrics in you PHP projects.

**PHP CodeSniffer**:

  pear install PHP_CodeSniffer

**phploc** (you must have pear channel pear.phpunit.de that we added while installing PHPUnit):

  pear install phpunit/phploc

**PHP Depend**:

  pear channel-discover pear.pdepend.org 
  pear install pdepend/PHP_Depend-beta

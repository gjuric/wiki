====== Time synchronization ======

To make sure our servers time is always up to date we are going to install ntp package which enables our server to use NTP protocol for syncing your servers clock.

  apt-get install ntp

If your data center, or VPS provider offers an NTP server it is wise to use their NTP server. Open up /etc/ntp.conf with nano and replace:

  server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic

with

  server ADDRESS-OF-NTP-SERVER-YOU-WANT-TO-USE

After saving the changes you have to restart the NTP service by running

  invoke-rc.d ntp restart

''invoke-rc.d'' is Debians shortcut to /etc/init.d/. You can run ''/etc/init.d/ntp restart'' as well.

You can examine if the NTP server is working as expected if you run the ''ntpq -p'' command:

example:~# ntpq -p
       remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
   ==============================================================================
   zg1.ntp.CARNet. 161.53.1.2       2 u   58   64    3    7.157  106.619   4.158
   zg2.ntp.CARNet. 161.53.1.2       2 u   57   64    3    7.677   25.934   4.792
   morcic.RI.CARNe 161.53.1.2       2 u   58   64    3   11.796   26.527   7.751

After a while the **reach** column should have values greather that 0. Which means that the NTP servers we are pooling for time information are reachable.

====== Anti-spam and Anti-virus ======


This part is taken from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostfixAmavisNew

Install Amavis, Clamav and SpamAssassin

  apt-get install amavisd-new spamassassin clamav-daemon

Note: libnet-dns-perl libmail-spf-query-perl pyzor razor are installed as dependencies.

Add **contrib** and **non-free** repositories by editing ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' and append " contrib non-free" on every line that starts with deb, and ends with main. You should be looking at something like this:

<file>
# deb http://ftp.carnet.hr/debian/ lenny main

deb http://ftp.carnet.hr/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.carnet.hr/debian/ lenny main

deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main

deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main contrib non-free
deb-src http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
</file>

After editing ''sources.list'' run

  apt-get update

Now, we can install utilities for compression and decompression of archives

  apt-get install arj bzip2 cabextract cpio file gzip lha nomarch pax rar unrar unzip zip zoo

Add clamav user to the amavis group and vice versa in order for Clamav to have access to scan files:

  adduser clamav amavis
  adduser amavis clamav

Enable SpamAssassin by editing ''/etc/default/spamassassin'' and setting

  ENABLED=1

and start SpamAssassin with

  invoke-rc.d spamassassin start

Edit ''/etc/amavis/conf.d/15-content_filter_mode'' and ucomment antivirus and spam checking

<file>
use strict;

# You can modify this file to re-enable SPAM checking through spamassassin
# and to re-enable antivirus checking.

#
# Default antivirus checking mode
# Uncomment the two lines below to enable it back
#

@bypass_virus_checks_maps = (
   \%bypass_virus_checks, \@bypass_virus_checks_acl, \$bypass_virus_checks_re);


#
# Default SPAM checking mode
# Uncomment the two lines below to enable it back
#

@bypass_spam_checks_maps = (
   \%bypass_spam_checks, \@bypass_spam_checks_acl, \$bypass_spam_checks_re);

1;  # ensure a defined return
</file>

Bouncing spam can be a bad idea as the return address is often faked, so it may have your server put on a blacklist. Edit /etc/amavis/conf.d/20-debian_defaults and change:

  $final_spam_destiny       = D_PASS;

Bouncing spam is not a good idea. I suggest you also change default spam levels and lover them at a later time if you start getting to much spam:

  $sa_spam_subject_tag = '***SPAM*** ';
  $sa_tag_level_deflt  = 6.0;  # add spam info headers if at, or above that level
  $sa_tag2_level_deflt = 10; # add 'spam detected' headers at that level
  $sa_kill_level_deflt = 10; # triggers spam evasive actions
  $sa_dsn_cutoff_level = 10;   # spam level beyond which a DSN is not sent

Configuring other options (including SpamAssasing are currently out of scope for this document).

Change the permissions on ''/var/lib/amavis/tmp''

  chmod -R 775 /var/lib/amavis/tmp

After configuration Amavis needs to be restarted:

sudo /etc/init.d/amavis restart

To integrate Amavis with Postfix we need to add the ''content_filter'' in ''/etc/postfix/main.cf''

  content_filter = smtp-amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024


Open ''/etc/postfix/master.cf'' and add this at the end of the file:

<file>
smtp-amavis     unix    -       -       -       -       2       smtp
        -o smtp_data_done_timeout=1200
        -o smtp_send_xforward_command=yes
        -o disable_dns_lookups=yes
        -o max_use=20

127.0.0.1:10025 inet    n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
        -o content_filter=
        -o local_recipient_maps=
        -o relay_recipient_maps=
        -o smtpd_restriction_classes=
        -o smtpd_delay_reject=no
        -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
        -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
        -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
        -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
        -o smtpd_data_restrictions=reject_unauth_pipelining
        -o smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions=
        -o mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8
        -o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
        -o smtpd_soft_error_limit=1001
        -o smtpd_hard_error_limit=1000
        -o smtpd_client_connection_count_limit=0
        -o smtpd_client_connection_rate_limit=0
        -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks,no_unknown_recipient_checks
</file>

and add this immediately below the "pickup" transport service:

<code>
         -o content_filter=
         -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks
</code>

This will prevent messages that are generated to report on spam from being classified as spam. 

Restart Postfix:

  /etc/init.d/postfix restart

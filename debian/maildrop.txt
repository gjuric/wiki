====== Maildrop ======

To achieve automatic moving of messages to the Junk folder we will have to use Maildrop instead of the Postix local delivery agent. This, on the other hand, has some drawbacks. When we tell Postix to use Maildrop as a local delivery agent, we will have to create Maildirs for new mailboxes by hand every time we create a new email account. But do not worry, this step can be automated.

To install maildrop, run

  apt-get install maildrop

Maildrop config file is located at ''/etc/maildroprc'', open it and replace the content with:

<code bash>
# Global maildrop filter file (used on Debian)
# For use with Postfix/Courier IMAP/Amavisd-new virtual mailbox domains.
#
# This maildroprc automagically creates a Spam folder for the recipient
# and places spam there. It also subscibes the recipient to the folder.
#
# Example maildir: /home/vmail/example.com/user/
#
# Also in main.cf:
# virtual_transport = maildrop
# maildrop_destination_concurrency_limit = 2
# maildrop_destination_recipient_limit = 1
#
# and in master.cf:
#
# maildrop  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
#  flags=DRhu user=vmail:daemon argv=/usr/bin/maildrop -w 90 -d ${user}@${nexthop}
#  ${extension} ${recipient} ${user} ${nexthop}
#
# /var/log/maildroprc.log needs to exist and owned by vmail:vmail and
# a logrotate script needs to be created.
#
HOME_DIR="/home/vmail"
logfile "/var/log/maildroprc.log"
EXTENSION="$1"
RECIPIENT=tolower("$2")
USER="$3"

# Check if host and user directory exist

`test -e $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER`

# Only continue if directory does NOT exist
if ($RETURNCODE != 0)
{
        log "MailDir $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER does NOT exist"
        `test -e $HOME_DIR/$HOST`
        if ( $RETURNCODE != 0 )
        {
                log "Creating $HOME_DIR/$HOST"
                `mkdir $HOME_DIR/$HOST`
                `chmod -R 0700 $HOME_DIR/$HOST`
        }

        # Create users MailDir
        `maildirmake $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER`
}

if (/^X-Spam-Flag: YES/)
{
        EXTENSION = "Junk"

        # See if the spam directory already exists
        `test -e $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/.$EXTENSION`
        #log "Testing for $EXTENSION subdirectory: result=$RETURNCODE"
        if ( $RETURNCODE != 0 ) # spam directory does not exist - so we create it
        {
                # Create the subdirectory
                `maildirmake -f $EXTENSION $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER`
                log "Ran \"maildirmake -f $EXTENSION $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER\""

                # Auto-subscribe the subdirectory
                `if ! grep -q INBOX.$EXTENSION $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/courierimapsubscribed; then echo INBOX.$EXTENSION >> $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/courierimapsubscribed; fi`
        }

        # Deliver the message to the mailbox
        exception {
                # for those who unsubscribed themselves - subscribe them
                `if ! grep -q INBOX.$EXTENSION $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/courierimapsubscribed; then echo INBOX.$EXTENSION >> $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/courierimapsubscribed; fi`
                to "$HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/.$EXTENSION"
        }

This script is a modified version of the script I took from http://www200.pair.com/mecham/spam/virtual.html and it does two things:

  - Creates the folders for the users mail on the server if they do not exist (this is the part that Postfix virtual delivery agent does automatically)
  - Checks if the messages has the ''X-Spam-Flag: YES'' header and delivers the message to the Junk folder (it creates one if it doesn't exist)

Create the log file, and change ownership:

  touch /var/log/maildroprc.log
  chown vmail:vmail /var/log/maildroprc.log

To automatically rotate logs for the maildroprc.log file create ''/etc/logrotate.d/maildroprc'' and paste this:

<file>
/var/log/maildroprc.log {
    rotate 7
    daily
    compress
    delaycompress
    copytruncate
    notifempty
}
</file>

Edit ''/etc/postfix/main.cf'' and add

  virtual_transport = maildrop
  maildrop_destination_concurrency_limit = 2
  maildrop_destination_recipient_limit = 1

Note: you already have ''virtual_transport = virtual'', you have to replace this line and change ''virtual'' to ''maildrop''.

Edit ''/etc/postfix/master.cf'' and look for

  maildrop  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
    flags=DRhu user=vmail argv=/usr/bin/maildrop -d ${recipient}

and replace it with

  maildrop  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
    flags=ODRhu user=vmail:daemon argv=/usr/bin/maildrop -w 90 -d ${user}@${nexthop}
    ${extension} ${recipient} ${user} ${nexthop}

This line invokes maildrop with some parameters. ''-w 90'' tells maildrop to copy the quota warning message if the user is over 90% of his mailbox quota.

The quota warning message must be located in  ''/etc/quotawarnmsg'' and it should look something like this:

<file>

X-Comment: Rename/Copy this file to quotawarnmsg, and make appropriate changes
X-Comment: See deliverquota man page for more information
From: Mail Delivery System <postmaster@diabmon.com>
Reply-To: postmaster@diabmon.com
To: Valued Customer:;
Subject: Mail quota warning
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Your mailbox on the server is now more than 90% full. So that you can continue to receive mail you need to remove some messages from your mailbox.
</file>

Todo: I don't get the body off the message, everything is in the headers, need to check this one out.

Unfortunately Postfix Admin does not allow entering quota values, but id does create the needed columns in the database table ''mbox''. To enter quota values log into mysql and add the quota value for the mailbox you wish to have quota applied. Your mailbox should have something like this:

<code>
mysql> select * from mailbox;
+-----------------+----------+-------------+--------------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+
| username        | password | name        | maildir            | quota     | local_part | domain       | created             | modified            | active |
+-----------------+----------+-------------+--------------------+-----------+------------+--------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+
| gog@diabmon.com | ommited  | Goran Juric | mail@example.com/  | 100000000 | mail       | example.com  | 2009-04-14 00:53:38 | 2009-04-14 00:53:38 |      1 |
</code>

Maildrop will get quota information using Couriers ''/etc/courier/authmysqlrc'' settings. Rhat is the reason why we have added 

  MYSQL_QUOTA_FIELD concat(quota,'S')

in that config file.

Change the permissions on ''/var/lib/amavis/tmp''

  chmod -R 775 /var/lib/amavis/tmp

After configuration Amavis needs to be restarted:

  /etc/init.d/amavis restart

Restart Postfix:

  /etc/init.d/postfix restart

Send a test email to check that everything is working.

===== Per user filtering =====

If you would like to have the ability to provide per user filtering you will have to modify ''/etc/maildroprc'' to

  - check if there is a "mailfilter" file in the users directory
  - include the file

Note: you can use some other file name if you like

You can change it to look like this:

<code bash>
[....]
        # Create users MailDir
        `maildirmake $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER`
}

`test -e $DEFAULT/mailfilter`
if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
{
     exception {
         log "Including $HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/mailfilter..."
         include "$HOME_DIR/$HOST/$USER/mailfilter"
     }
}

if (/^X-Spam-Flag: YES/)
[...]
</code>

All you have to do now is to put your rules in the mailfilter file.

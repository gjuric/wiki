====== Postfix - Debian Lenny (5.0) / Ubuntu ======

[[http://gogs.info/books/debian-mail/|This article is outdated. Updated version on building a mail server on Debian 6 is published as a free eBook here.]]

If you haven't already installed Postfix, do it now:

  apt-get install postfix telnet mailx

Note: we are also installing telnet so we can easily check if everything is going well during the installation and configuration. As well as mailx package so we can send emails from the terminal using the ''mail'' command.

During installation Postfix will ask you to choose the type of installation and a domain. Choose **Internet site** and enter your servers name **atlantis.example.com**. It is important that your server name is not just **example.com**.

After installation finishes check if Postfix is runing by connecting to port 25 on your localhost with telnet:

  # telnet localhost 25
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  220 diabmon.com ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)

Note: Type **quit** to exit.

If you see Postfix responding, Postfix is working. For another check we can try to send email to one of your email accounts:

  mail your-other-email@somedomain.com

  Subject: test email from example.com
  test body of the email.
  .
  Cc:

You should be getting this email message on the account you specified.

Check that you have your ''example.com'' in a file ''/etc/mailname''

Open ''/etc/postfix/main.cf'', it should look something like this:

<file>
# See /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist for a commented, more complete version


# Debian specific:  Specifying a file name will cause the first
# line of that file to be used as the name.  The Debian default
# is /etc/mailname.
#myorigin = /etc/mailname

smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name (Debian/GNU)
biff = no

# appending .domain is the MUA's job.
append_dot_mydomain = no

# Uncomment the next line to generate "delayed mail" warnings
#delay_warning_time = 4h

readme_directory = no

# TLS parameters
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
smtpd_use_tls=yes
smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache

# See /usr/share/doc/postfix/TLS_README.gz in the postfix-doc package for
# information on enabling SSL in the smtp client.

myhostname = atlantis.example.com
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
myorigin = /etc/mailname
mydestination = atlantis.example.com, localhost.example.com, localhost
relayhost =
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
inet_interfaces = all
</file>

If your hostname is something like atlantis.example.com and not just example.com you can change ''myorigin = /etc/mailname'' to

  myorigin = $mydomain

and ''mydestination = atlantis.example.com, localhost.example.com, localhost'' to 

  mydestination = $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain, localhost

If your hostname is just example.com doing this will set your origin to just ''.com''. Postfix extract $mydomain from the value of the myhostname and strips the part before the first dot, including the dot.

You can also remove IPV6 notation from the mynetworks and leave just ''mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8''.

Restart Postfix

  invoke-rc.d postfix restart

and try to send another test mail to check that we didn't mess something up.

Now it would be a good time to also test if Postfix is receiving mails as well. Try sending an email to just ''root'' and to ''root@example.com''. The received email should be located in a file ''/var/mail/root''. Check that file and make sure that you are sending email from the right domain (sender should be root@example.com). If you do not receive an email check the Postifx log file ''/var/log/mail.log'' to see what went wrong.

===== Postfix virtual user =====

First we need to create a **vmail** user and group (with ID 5000) on the system. This is a system user who will store all of our email messages.

  groupadd -g 5000 vmail
  useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin -g vmail -u 5000 vmail -d /home/vmail -m

It is important that the vmail user can not login and belongs to vmail group. We are also creating a /home/vmail folder. It is going to hold all of the messages on our mail server.

===== Postfix and MySQL =====

Install some more packages

  apt-get install postfix postfix-mysql mysql-server postfix-tls libsasl2-2 libsasl2-modules libsasl2-modules-sql sasl2-bin libpam-mysql openssl telnet mailx

Do not bother with the packages we already installed, they will be skipped.

We are going to use Postfix Admin for managing the virtual mail users and domains in the MySQL so we need to create database and tables in the MySQL.

Download Postfix Admin using wget. Currently the latest version is 2.3RC3 (check the Postfix Admin site for the latest version).

  cd /root
  wget http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/postfixadmin/postfixadmin_2.3rc3.tar.gz
  tar xvzzf postfixadmin_2.3rc3.tar.gz
  
move the extracted folder to ''/var/www/postfix''

  mv /root/postfixadmin-2.3rc3 /var/www/postfix

Before installing Postfix Admin we must create a database and a user to access the database where we will store all of the information about our domains.

Start MySQL:

  mysql -u root -p

once in MySQL enter

  CREATE DATABASE mail;

Now we need to create a MySQL user that will have privileges to read and edit the mail database (change the ''newpassword'' to something else):

  CREATE USER 'mailadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mail` . * TO 'mailadmin'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

you can exit MySQL now by typing ''exit''.

Open /var/www/postfix/config.inc.php with nano and change setting to:

<file>
 * The following line needs commenting out or removing before the
 * application will run!
 * Doing this implies you have changed this file as required.
 */
$CONF['configured'] = true;


// Postfix Admin Path
// Set the location of your Postfix Admin installation here.
// YOU MUST ENTER THE COMPLETE URL e.g. http://domain.tld/postfixadmin
$CONF['postfix_admin_url'] = 'http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS/postfix';

// shouldn't need changing.
$CONF['postfix_admin_path'] = dirname(__FILE__);

// Language config
// Language files are located in './languages', change as required..
$CONF['default_language'] = 'en';

// Database Config
// mysql = MySQL 3.23 and 4.0, 4.1 or 5
// mysqli = MySQL 4.1+
// pgsql = PostgreSQL
$CONF['database_type'] = 'mysql';
$CONF['database_host'] = 'localhost';
$CONF['database_user'] = 'mailadmin';
$CONF['database_password'] = 'newpassword';
$CONF['database_name'] = 'mail';
$CONF['database_prefix'] = '';
</file>

close the file and open http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS/postfix/setup.php in your browser if everything went well you should be prompted to create the super admin account. Create the account, and after you log in into Postfix Admin create a new virtual domain 'example.com', and create new user accout ''root@example.com''.

Since now we have created our MySQL tables it is time to change some Postfix setting. First we need to create 4 files in the /etc/postfix/ folder:

mysql_virtual_alias_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = alias
select_field = goto
where_field = address
</file>

mysql_virtual_domains_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = domain
select_field = domain
where_field = domain
additional_conditions = and backupmx = '0' and active = '1'
</file>

mysql_virtual_mailbox_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = mailbox
select_field = maildir
where_field = username
additional_conditions = and active = '1'
</file>

Although most of the guides on the net use this file, I do not like it because mailboxes for all virtual domains are saved in /home/vmail/username@domain.com . I like to separate my domain so that every domain has its own folder: ''/home/vmail/domain.com/username''. So we are going to change this file to:

<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = mailbox
query = SELECT CONCAT(domain,'/',SUBSTRING_INDEX(maildir,'@',1),'/') FROM mailbox WHERE username='%s' AND active = 1
</file>

TODO: Postfix Admin can be configure do store paths to maildirs in a ''/domain/user'' format. I need to change this in the tutorial to use the simpler version of the query.

/etc/postfix/mysql_relay_domains_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = domain
select_field = domain
where_field = domain
additional_conditions = and backupmx = '1'
</file>

Since these files contain passwords, we need to protect them:

  atlantis:/etc/postfix# chgrp postfix /etc/postfix/mysql_*.cf
  atlantis:/etc/postfix# chmod 640 /etc/postfix/mysql_*.cf

Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and at the bottom of the file add:

<file>
# Virtual Mailbox Domain Settings

virtual_mailbox_base = /home/vmail
virtual_transport = virtual
virtual_alias_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql_virtual_alias_maps.cf
virtual_mailbox_domains = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql_virtual_domains_maps.cf
virtual_mailbox_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql_virtual_mailbox_maps.cf
virtual_minimum_uid = 5000
virtual_uid_maps = static:5000
virtual_gid_maps = static:5000

# Domains for which we are a secondary MX
relay_domains = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql_relay_domains_maps.cfl
</file>

You also need to delete everything in the ''mydestination='' directive because every domain that is entered in the ''mydestionation'' is treated as a "local" domain so the mail gets delivered to the local server users and it is located in ''/var/spool/mail''.

Restart postfix

  invoke-rc.d postfix restart

send email to ''root@example.com''.


  mail root@example.com

  Subject: test email from example.com
  test body of the email.
  .
  Cc:

Check your ''/home/vmail/example.com'' folder. There should be a ''root'' folder inside, with 3 folders inside ''root'' : cur  new  tmp. Inside the folder new you should see your email message. If this didn't work, check ''/var/log/mail.log'' for possible hints on what went wrong.

===== Saslauthd =====

Since we want to allow users to log in to our mail server so they can send emails, we need to configure some kind of protection. First we need to make sure users can log in using the same username and password as the one they will be using for checking email.

For this, we are going to use Saslauthd. We installed it at the beginning of this chapter when we were installing Postfix. Saslauthd will also use MySQL to verify user credentials.

Open ''/etc/default/saslauthd'' with nano and change ''START=no'' to

  START=yes

and at the end of the file we need to change ''OPTIONS="-c -m /var/run/saslauthd"'' to

  OPTIONS="-c -r -m /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd"

We also need to create this directory

  mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd

and one symbolic link (because Postfix on Debian is running from a chrooted environment and other applications you maybe using on your server (including testsaslauthd for testing if saslauthd is working correctly) are not aware of us changing the saslauthd directory).

  ln -s /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd /var/run/saslauthd
 
We also need to create two more files:

  nano /etc/pam.d/smtp

<file>
auth    required   pam_mysql.so user=mailadmin passwd=newpassword host=127.0.0.1 db=mail table=mailbox usercolumn=username passwdcolumn=password crypt=1
account sufficient pam_mysql.so user=mailadmin passwd=newpassword host=127.0.0.1 db=mail table=mailbox usercolumn=username passwdcolumn=password crypt=1
</file>

  nano /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf

<file>
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
mech_list: plain login
allow_plaintext: true
auxprop_plugin: mysql
sql_hostnames: 127.0.0.1
sql_user: mailadmin
sql_passwd: newpassword
sql_database: mail
sql_select: select password from mailbox where username = '%u' and active = '1'
</file>

We need to add Postfix to the sasl group so it can access the saslauthd process we just setup:

  adduser postfix sasl

Restart Postfix and sasl

  /etc/init.d/postfix restart
  /etc/init.d/saslauthd restart

Now, we can check is saslauthd is working correctly

  testsaslauthd -s smtp -u root@example.com -p newpassword

Ofcourse, replace root@example.com with the mail account you have created with Postfix Admin, and newpassword with the password you have set for this user.

  atlantis:~# testsaslauthd -s smtp -u root@example.com -p newpassword
  0: OK "Success."

If you do not get "Success." as a response, check that you have a symbolic link in /var/run/ named saslauthd and that it points to ''/var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslautdh''.

We have to change permissions to these two files as well:

  chgrp sasl /etc/pam.d/smtp
  chmod 640 /etc/pam.d/smtp
  chgrp postfix /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
  chmod 640 /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf

Restart Postfix and sasl

  /etc/init.d/postfix restart
  /etc/init.d/saslauthd restart

===== TLS =====

Now, we are going to configure Postfix to use TLS. If you still haven't created a self signed certificates [[Server certificates|do it now]].

Edit ''/etc/postfix/main.cf'' and look for the part containing:

<file>
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
smtpd_use_tls=yes
smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
</file>

and replace it with

<file>
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes
smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header = yes
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, reject_unauth_destination
smtpd_use_tls = yes
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/self-signed/server.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file = $smtpd_tls_cert_file
</file>

Note: ''/etc/ssl/self-signed/server.pem'' should point to the location of your .pem file.

We are telling Postfix that we want to allow sending emails without authentication for our networks (localhost) and for users that authenticated using sasl we configured previously.

Restart Postfix and try to send an email using your email client from your workstation. You will not be able to read emails yet. Just make sure that username you are using is your full email address, that you've selected to use authentication for your SMTP server and that TLS is selected. (Note: change the firewall rules before).

===== Enable submission port =====

Many ISPs today block port 25 for users. To be able to send email using our Postfix mail server as our outgoing server, we need to enable submission port (port 587) for Postfix.

Open ''/etc/postfix/master.cf'' and uncomment the folloging lines:

<file>
submission inet n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
  -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt
  -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
  -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_sasl_authenticated,reject
  -o milter_macro_daemon_name=ORIGINATING
</file>

Note: spaces in the lines after the first line are important. Do not delete them!

===== Banning attachments =====

To block certain extensions of attachments (.exe, .bat, ...) edit ''/etc/postfix/main.cf'' and add

  mime_header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/mime_header_checks

Create ''/etc/postfix/mime_header_checks'' and insert

  /name=[^>]*\.(bat|com|exe|dll|vbs)$/ REJECT
  
add all the extension you want to disable here.


===== Maximum message size =====

Default maximum size of the message is 10240000 bytes (10 MB), to change this to 20MB edit ''/etc/postfix/main.cf''

  message_size_limit = 20480000

===== Important commands =====

  * postconf mail_version - Find out what Postfix Version is installed
  * mailq - Show Mail Queue
  * postsuper -d ALL - Remove bounced mail from the queue.
  * postfix flush - Flush the Mail Queue
  * postfix check - Check Installation

===== Postfix firewall rules =====

You have to change Firewall rules to allow inbound connections to ports that Postfix uses:

  * Port 25 for incoming mail from other mail servers and from clients (if they can use this port)
  * Submission port 587 for incoming mail from users

====== Static IP address ======

In case your server is connected to a network which broadcasts DHCP you didn't get a chance to configure a static IP address for your server.

Enter ''ifconfig'' and copy the output somewhere so you have access to network information you got from a DHCP server.

Open up /etc/network/interfaces with nano and replace 

  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet dhcp

with

  iface eth0 inet static
        address YOUR-IP
        netmask YOUR-NETMASK
        network YOUR-NETWORK
        broadcast YOUR-BROADCAST
        gateway YOUR-GATEWAY
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers YOUR-DNS-SERVERS-SEPARATED-BY-SPACE
        dns-search YOUR-DOMAIN
  
Reboot your server, check that your internet connection is working (try to ping google.com or some other host) and if everything is ok you can remove dhcp3-* packages from your system.

  apt-get --purge remove dhcp3-common dhcp3-client

Note that option --purge removes configuration files of the packages we are removing. If you do not use --purge they will be left on your system.

====== Mail server ======


We are going to install Postfix as our MTA (SMTP server) and [[http://www.courier-mta.org/|Courier]] as our POP/IMAP server. [[http://www.postfix.org/|Postfix]] will user virtual domains, and information about our domains and users will be stored in the MySQL database. For managing virtual domains and users we will use [[http://postfixadmin.sourceforge.net/|PostfixAdmin]].

For virus scanning and spam protection of our emails we will use [[http://www.clamav.net/|ClamAV]] and [[http://spamassassin.apache.org/|Spamassassin]] that will be run using [[http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/|amavisd-new]].

Note: this tutorial is a combination of tutorials published on http://articles.slicehost.com/email and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostfixCompleteVirtualMailSystemHowto.

You also must have a valid MX record in the DNS zone of your domain pointing to the IP address of the server.

====== Essential software ======

Since we opted for a bare bones system we are going to install some utility packages and an SSH server so we can connect to our server using [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/|Putty]], or a *nix shell.

  apt-get install ssh wget nano dnsutils

  * Nano is a text editor. More user friendly than vi.
  * We will use wget to fetch stuff from the internet
  * dnsutils package will allow us to troubleshoot possible DNS problems on our system

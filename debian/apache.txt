====== Apache ======

We are going to use Apache mod_php for running PHP scripts so we need to install apache2-mpm-preform MPM. MPM worker does not play nicely with mod_php because PHP is not thread safe. mod_php is the fastest way of running PHP sites so you dont really need to think to much over this option. If you are low on memory resources you could install Lighttpd and run PHP as a FastCGI but then I guess you do not want to install Postfix or use the same machine as a mail server, so skip installing Postfix as well.

  apt-get install apache2 apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils ssl-cert

mod_rewrite is not enabled by default so we will enable it and restart Apache

  a2enmod rewrite
  invoke-rc.d apache2 restart

Open up your web browser and try to visit http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS you should see "It works!" displayed in your browser if Apache is working normally.

If you can not access the page, check your firewall rules. Port 80 should be open. If not, rebuild the firewall rules making sure that this time the port 80 is open, copy them to /etc/network/iptables.rules and reboot your server.

===== Configure Virtual Hosts =====

Since we only have one IP address we are going to use Apaches [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html|name-based virtual hosting]] for serving multiple domains from a single server.

Configuration files for sites are located in ''/etc/apache2/sites-available'' and symbolic links for active sites are created in ''/etc/apache2/sites-enabled''.

Now, we are going to create a configuration file for out example.com domain. Create an example.com in ''/etc/apache2/sites-available'' using ''nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com'' and save this in the file:

<file>
<VirtualHost *:80>

        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
        ServerName example.com
        ServerAlias www.example.com

        DocumentRoot /home/www/example.com/public_html

        ErrorLog /home/www/example.com/logs/error.log

        # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
        # alert, emerg.
        LogLevel warn

        CustomLog /home/www/example.com/logs/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
</file>

You can see that the DocumentRoot points to ''/home/www/...''. This is because I choose to save all my sites in the ''/home/www'' folder in which every domain has its own folder.

Since those folders for our domain still don't exist, we need to create them

  mkdir /home/www
  mkdir /home/www/example.com
  mkdir /home/www/example.com/logs
  mkdir /home/www/example.com/public_html

As you can see, we can tell Apache to save log files for each virtual host separately.

Od Debian systems Apache runs as user www-data. So we need to give permissions to Apache to read and write to this folders. We can change the owner and the group of all files with

  chown www-data:www-data -R /home/www/

We are ready to enable our new virtual host

  a2ensite example.com
  update-rc.d apache2 restart

If you want to add other sites to your server, just create another file in the ''/etc/apache2/sites-available'' folder and repeat the procedure.

===== Apache configuration =====

Default configuration of Apache sends server information in the response headers that we do not want to expose to everybody. To disable this open /etc/apache2/conf.d/security with nano and replace

  ServerTokens Full
  ServerSignature On

with 

  ServerTokens Prod
  ServerSignature Off

All application on my web server use UTF-8 as a default encoding so I also edit /etc/apache2/conf.d/charset and uncomment the ''AddDefaultCharset UTF-8'' directive which adds the UTF-8 as the default charset to the header for all files Apache sends to clients.

All that is left to do is to restart Apache once again

  update-rc.d apache2 restart

===== Rotate logs for virtual domains =====

Since log files for every domain are located in the /home/www/DOMAIN-NAME/logs we need to make appropriate changes to the **logrotate** utility which is used for rotating log files.

... TODO ...

===== Install and configure Awstats =====

  apt-get install awstats gzip

Configure awstats

  cd /usr/share/doc/awstats/examples/
  gunzip awstats.model.conf.gz
  cp awstats.model.conf /etc/awstats/
  mkdir wwwroot
  mkdir wwwroot/cgi-bin
  cp awstats.model.conf wwwroot/cgi-bin/
  perl awstats_configure.pl

Copying ''awstats.model.conf'' to ''/etc/awstats/'' is needed because this file is referenced from the ''awstats_configure.pl'' script, but somebody forgot to put it there when they were packaging awstats for Debian.

Run the awstats configuration script:

<code>
atlantis:/usr/share/doc/awstats/examples# perl awstats_configure.pl

----- AWStats awstats_configure 1.0 (build 1.7) (c) Laurent Destailleur -----
This tool will help you to configure AWStats to analyze statistics for
one web server. You can try to use it to let it do all that is possible
in AWStats setup, however following the step by step manual setup
documentation (docs/index.html) is often a better idea. Above all if:
- You are not an administrator user,
- You want to analyze downloaded log files without web server,
- You want to analyze mail or ftp log files instead of web log files,
- You need to analyze load balanced servers log files,
- You want to 'understand' all possible ways to use AWStats...
Read the AWStats documentation (docs/index.html).

-----> Running OS detected: Linux, BSD or Unix
Warning: AWStats standard directory on Linux OS is '/usr/local/awstats'.
If you want to use standard directory, you should first move all content
of AWStats distribution from current directory:
/usr/share/doc/awstats/examples
to standard directory:
/usr/local/awstats
And then, run configure.pl from this location.
Do you want to continue setup from this NON standard directory [yN] ? y

-----> Check for web server install

Enter full config file path of your Web server.
Example: /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Example: /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
Example: c:\Program files\apache group\apache\conf\httpd.conf
Config file path ('none' to skip web server setup):
> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

-----> Check and complete web server config file '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf'

-----> Need to create a new config file ?
Do you want me to build a new AWStats config/profile
file (required if first install) [y/N] ? y


-----> Define config file name to create
What is the name of your web site or profile analysis ?
Example: www.mysite.com
Example: demo
Your web site, virtual server or profile name:
> default

-----> Define config file path
In which directory do you plan to store your config file(s) ?
Default: /etc/awstats
Directory path to store config file(s) (Enter for default):
>

-----> Create config file '/etc/awstats/awstats.default.conf'
 Config file /etc/awstats/awstats.default.conf created.

-----> Add update process inside a scheduler
Sorry, configure.pl does not support automatic add to cron yet.
You can do it manually by adding the following command to your cron:
/usr/share/doc/awstats/examples/wwwroot/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -update -config=default
Or if you have several config files and prefer having only one command:
/usr/share/doc/awstats/examples/tools/awstats_updateall.pl now
Press ENTER to continue...


A SIMPLE config file has been created: /etc/awstats/awstats.default.conf
You should have a look inside to check and change manually main parameters.
You can then manually update your statistics for 'default' with command:
> perl awstats.pl -update -config=default
You can also read your statistics for 'default' with URL:
> http://localhost/awstats/awstats.pl?config=default

Press ENTER to finish...
</code>

  nano /etc/awstats/awstats.default.conf

change LogFile= to

  LogFile="/var/log/apache2/access.log"

Run awstats

  /usr/lib/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -update -config=default

This will run awstats for the default profile. Default profile takes care of the log files that are used when serving content from the ''/var/www''. Since, you probably will just use virtual domains you have to create a separate awstats config file for each domain. Just make sure that every domain has a different answer for ''Your web site, virtual server or profile name:'' question.

You will also have to edit config file for each domain (located in ''/etc/awstats'') and change the location to the config file.


Awstats package has created a cron job that should generate logs for awstats regularly, but it doesn't fit our needs, so we are going to edit it, open ''/etc/cron.d/awstats'' and replace

  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * www-data [ -x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -a -f /etc/awstats/awstats.conf -a -r /var/log/apache/access.log ] && /usr/lib/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -config=awstats -update >/dev/null

with an entry for every one of our domains

  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -config=default -update >/dev/null


The is also alo a script in ''/usr/share/doc/awstats/examples/awstats_updateall.pl'' that you can use to update all domains at once.

To display data awstats created fetch the latest version of [[http://www.jawstats.com/|Jawstats]] and unpack it somewhere in you domains public_html folder. Copy ''config.dist.php'' to ''config.php'' and add all the domains you want Jawstats to fetch information from the database awstats creates.

Important: If you store all awstats information for you virtual domains in the same place. One user of the server will be able to edit ''config.php'' and view statistics for other domain. If this is an issue for you, you should change awstats domain configuration files and point ''DirData'' for each domain to a separate folder. You could for example create ''awstats'' inside every ''/home/www/domain''. Youd would then have 3 folders inside every ''/home/www/domain'' directory

  * logs - raw access and error log files from Apache
  * public - place to put your web site in (this is the folder Apache looks in when serving pages)
  * awstats - awstats database (processed Apache log files)

===== Configure HTTPS =====

If you need HTTPS access to your virtual hosts you will have to:
  - create a certificate for the virtual domain that you want to serve using HTTPS
  - add a new <VirtualHost> section into you ''/etc/apache2/sites-available/domain'' file (you can use the content from ''default-ssl'' as a template for this section)
  - open port 443 on your firewall

====== Debian server ======

We are going to install a new web server named atlantis that is supposed to serve HTTP traffic for example.com domain.

===== Installation =====

Download Debian Lenny Tiny CD from http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst and burn the image to a compact disk, or mount it as a CD image in your virtualisation software.

Boot your computer and select Install, after that you only need to choose your Language, Country and Keymap you want to use. If your computer is not connected to a network with DHCP you will be prompted to enter network connection parameters manually. After configuring your network and DNS server you will be asked for a hostname, in our case, the hostname is **atlantis** and our domain name is **example.com**.

When prompted to select Debian mirror the selected choice is usually the best one. If your are not using HTTP proxy on your internet connection, or don't know what HTTP proxy is, just leave this field blank.

When prompted to partition the disk for are Debian install, choose Guided - use entire disk. Install all files in one partition.

Grab a cup of coffee and wait until installation finishes fetching packages from the internet and installs the base system.

Enter your root password. This is a password for root user who has all the privileges on the system, so choose one carefully. After that, you have to create a new user for the system.

You will be asked if you want to participate in the Debians popularity contest which collects information about most used packages. Feel free to answer whatever you like, by choosing Yes you are helping the Debian community to find the most used packages in the distribution. Help them out, it doesn't cost you a thing.

When prompted to select collections of software packages deselect everrything. We just need to install the base system because we will add all needed packages when and if we need them.

Since Debian will be the only system on our machine we have to select to install GRUB on to the master boot record.

Your Debian system is almost ready to go. When asked, remove the installation media from your drive (or unmount the image in your virtualisation software) and reboot your computer.

When your computer boots up you can log in with the root user account and update the packages in your system running:

  apt-get update
  apt-get upgrade

And that is it. Your new Debian is installed and ready for configuration. It took me around 10 to 15 minutes from start to finish.

==== Essential software ====

Since we opted for a bare bones system we are going to install some utility packages and an SSH server so we can connect to our server using [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/|Putty]], or a *nix shell.

  apt-get install ssh wget nano

==== Static IP address ====

In case your server is connected to a network which broadcasts DHCP you didn't get a chance to configure a static IP address for your server.

Enter ''ifconfig'' and copy the output somewhere so you have access to network information you got from a DHCP server.

Open up /etc/network/interfaces with nano and replace 

  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet dhcp

with

  iface eth0 inet static
        address YOUR-IP
        netmask YOUR-NETMASK
        network YOUR-NETWORK
        broadcast YOUR-BROADCAST
        gateway YOUR-GATEWAY
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers YOUR-DNS-SERVERS-SEPARATED-BY-SPACE
        dns-search YOUR-DOMAIN
  
Reboot your server, check that your internet connection is working (try to ping google.com or some other host) and if everything is ok you can remove dhcp3-* packages from your system.

  apt-get --purge remove dhcp3-common dhcp3-client

Note that option --purge removes configuration files of the packages we are removing. If you do not use --purge they will be left on your system.

===== iptables =====

We are going to secure our web server using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables|iptables]] as a firewall.

  apt-get install iptables

If you check iptables rules with ''iptables -L'' you should see a clean chain list:

  example:~# iptables -L
  Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
  target     prot opt source               destination
  
  Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
  target     prot opt source               destination
  
  Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
  target     prot opt source               destination

To help us set up iptables rules we are going to use a modified version of a firewall script that is used for setting up QmailToaster on CentOS, the script looks like this:
<file>
#!/bin/sh
#

There are two important things your have to do. First replace the MY_IP with the IP address of your server. I am also using the ROUTER variable to configure the IP address that can bypass firewall rules because I want to have access to everything when I am in my network. My network is behind a NAT so the ROUTER IP is the IP address that the server sees when I connect to the server from within my company. I am using this because I do not want to open up SSH access to my server from the internet.

The script is very well documented and you just have to comment out the services you want to make accessible from the internet. In this case we are only opening up port 80 which is used for incoming connections to our Apache web server and we also tell iptables to respond to ICMP echo requests so we can use ''ping'' to establish if our server is alive.

If you don't have a "safe" IP address to allow access to your machine make sure you un-comment the rule for SSH (port 22), or you will not be able to connect to the machine using SSH. If that is the case, open up ''/etc/ssh/sshd_config'' and change Port from 22 to something else, and make sure you update the new port number in the firewall script. You can also consider some other techniques to secure your box ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking|port knocking]]) but they are out of the scope of this article.

Copy the script to /root/firewall.sh , cd into the /root directory and run

  sh ./firewall.sh

In case you don't get your prompt back, you did something wrong. Connect to the server, reboot it and try again.

You can now check your rules by using ''iptables -L -n'' and they should not be empty anymore.

The problem is, that if you reboot your server now, all of the rules would be lost, so we have to make sure they are applied whenever our server is rebooted.

The script populated the rules, but it also created a file called iptables.rules in our /root directory.

We are going to copy this file to the /etc/network folder.

  cp /root/iptables.rules /etc/network/

Now we need to edit the /etc/network/interfaces file. Use nano to open it and add

  pre-up iptables-restore < /etc/network/iptables.rules

after the configuration options for your network interface. This line will make sure that before network interface is initialized the rules will be loaded into iptables.

Reboot your server with

  reboot

and when it comes up again log in and check your iptables rules againg with ''iptables -L -n''. They should not be empty, if they are, you are doing something wrong.

===== Configuring NTP =====

To make sure our servers time is always up to date we are going to install ntp package which enables our server to use NTP protocol for syncing your servers clock.

  apt-get install ntp

If your data center, or VPS provider offers an NTP server it is wise to use their NTP server. Open up /etc/ntp.conf with nano and replace:

  server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic
  server 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst dynamic

with

  server ADDRESS-OF-NTP-SERVER-YOU-WANT-TO-USE

After saving the changes you have to restart the NTP service by running

  invoke-rc.d ntp restart

''invoke-rc.d'' is Debians shortcut to /etc/init.d/. You can run ''/etc/init.d/ntp restart'' as well.

You can examine if the NTP server is working as expected if you run the ''ntpq -p'' command:

example:~# ntpq -p
       remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
   ==============================================================================
   zg1.ntp.CARNet. 161.53.1.2       2 u   58   64    3    7.157  106.619   4.158
   zg2.ntp.CARNet. 161.53.1.2       2 u   57   64    3    7.677   25.934   4.792
   morcic.RI.CARNe 161.53.1.2       2 u   58   64    3   11.796   26.527   7.751

After a while the **reach** column should have values greather that 0. Which means that the NTP servers we are pooling for time information are reachable.

===== Server certificates =====

For information on how to create a self signed certificate take a look at http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html just make sure that you enter your host name when asked for ''Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []'' **atlantis.example.com**.

Now, you should have 4 files:

  * server.crt
  * server.csr
  * server.key
  * server.key.org

To create a .pem file you need to run:

  cat server.crt server.key > server.pem

Since server.key and server.pem contain server key that is not encrypted you have to make sure regular users on your server can not access these files.


===== LAMP =====

==== Before installation (MTA) ====

Installing MySQL, Apache and PHP on Debian systems is a breeze. But before installation of this packages we are going to install Postfix MTA because otherwise MySQL will install exim4 as a default MTA on our system (currently we don't have an MTA because we are running a minimal install server).

If you do not plan to run mail server on this machine, skip installing Postfix.

  apt-get install postfix bsd-mailx

If you plan to setup your own mail server on the same server choose Internet site. If not, you can just select Local only. Since I plan to install a mail server on the same machine I am choosing Internet site.

For the System mail name enter your servers name including the domain (atlantis.example.com).

==== MySQL ====

  apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

A advise you to set a password for root user.

==== Apache ====
We are going to use Apache mod_php for running PHP scripts so we need to install apache2-mpm-preform MPM because MPM worked does not play nicely with mod_php because PHP is not thread save. mod_php is the fastest way of running PHP sites so you dont really need to think to much over this option. If you are low on memory resources you could install Lighttpd and run PHP as a FastCGI but then I guess you do not want to install Postfix or use the same machine as a mail server, so skip installing Postfix as well.

  apt-get install apache2 apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils ssl-cert

mod_rewrite is not enabled by default so we will enable it and restart Apache

  a2enmod rewrite
  invoke-rc.d apache2 restart

Open up your web browser and try to visit http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS you should see "It works!" displayed in your browser if Apache is working normaly.

If you can not access the page, check your firewall rules that the port 80 is open. If not, rebuild the firewall rules making sure that this time the port 80 is open, copy them to /etc/network/iptables.rules and reboot your server.

=== Configure Virtual Hosts ===

Since we only have one IP address we are going to use Apaches [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html|name-based virtual hosting]].

Configuration files for sites that Apache server are located in ''/etc/apache2/sites-available'' and symbolic links for active sites are located in ''/etc/apache2/sites-enabled''.

Now, we are going to create a configuration file for out example.com domain. Create an example.com in ''/etc/apache2/sites-available'' using ''nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com'' and save this in the file:

<file>
<VirtualHost *:80>

        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
        ServerName example.com

        DocumentRoot /home/www/example.com/public_html

        ErrorLog /home/www/example.com/logs/error.log

        # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
        # alert, emerg.
        LogLevel warn

        CustomLog /home/www/example.com/logs/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
</file>

You can see that the DocumentRoot points to ''/home/www/...''. This is because I choose to save all my sites in the ''/home/www'' folder in which where every domain has its own folder.

Since those folders for our domain still don't exist, we need to create them

  mkdir /home/www
  mkdir /home/www/example.com
  mkdir /home/www/example.com/logs
  mkdir /home/www/example.com/public_html

As you can see, we can tell Apache to save log files for each virtual host separately.

Od Debian systems Apache runs as user www-data. So we need to give permissions to Apache to read and write to this folders. We can change the owner and the group of all files with

  chown www-data:www-data -R /home/www/

We are ready to enable our new virtual host

  a2ensite example.com
  update-rc.d apache2 restart

If you want to add other sites to your server, just create another file in the ''/etc/apache2/sites-available'' folder and repeat the procedure.

==== Apache configuration ====

Default configuration of Apache sends server information in the response headers that we do not want to expose to everybody. To disable thiso pen /etc/apache2/conf.d/security with nano and replace

  ServerTokens Full
  ServerSignature On

with 

  ServerTokens Prod
  ServerSignature Off

All application on my web server use UTF-8 as a default encoding so I also edit /etc/apache2/conf.d/charset and uncomment the ''AddDefaultCharset UTF-8'' directive which add the UTF-8 as the default charset in the header for all the content Apache sends to clients.

All that is left to do, is to restart Apache

  update-rc.d apache2 restart

== Rotate logs for virtual domains ==

Since log files for every domain Apache serves is located in the /home/www/DOMAIN-NAME/logs we need to make appropriate changes to the **logrotate** utility which is used for rotating log files.

... TODO ...

=== Configure HTTPS ===

.... TODO ....

==== PHP ====

To install PHP and mod_php module for Apache you have to run

  apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5 php5-common php5-curl php5-dev //
  php5-gd php-pear php5-imagick php5-imap php5-mcrypt php5-mhash php5-mysql //
  php5-pspell php5-recode php5-sqlite php5-tidy php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl php-apc imagemagick

If you do not need ImageMagick you can remove imagemagick and php5-imagick form the list. I use them because PHP Imagick extension provides a nice object oriented API to ImageMagick library.

php5-pspell installs aspell for spell checking purposes, which install aspell-en dictionary. If you need some other dictionaries for your PHP applications install them as well.

To check for available language dictionaries type:

  apt-cache search aspell-

A need Croation dictionary so I have to install it:

  apt-get install aspell-hr

Now it is time to restart the Apache server

  invoke-rc.d apache2 restart

By default, Apache server files from the /var/www folder on your server (we will change this later). To check if PHP is installed, create a new file using nano:

  nano /var/www/i.php

and inside enter: 

<file>
<?php phpinfo();
</file>

Try to open http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS/i.php with your browser and you should see a PHP Info page. Remove the i.php file since exposing information about your web server to everyone is not a good idea:

  rm /var/www/i.php

==== PHP configuration ====

If you view your sites response headers (you can us WebDeveloper Toolbar for Firefox) you will see something like this:

  Date: Mon, 13 Apr 2009 15:45:03 GMT
  Server: Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny2 with Suhosin-Patch
  X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny2
  Vary: Accept-Encoding
  Content-Encoding: gzip
  Content-Length: 10251
  Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=99
  Connection: Keep-Alive
  Content-Type: text/html

  200 OK

While we got rid of the ''Server:'' exposing PHP version, we also want to remove X-Powered-By header.

Open /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini and change

  expose_php = On

to 

  expose_php = Off

While you are in the php.ini file change ''magic_quotes_gpc = On'' to ''magic_quotes_gpc = Off''. I don't know why but Debian still ships PHP with magic quotes set to On.

Reboot the Apache web server and check the response headers. Now you should see something like this:

  Date: Mon, 13 Apr 2009 15:57:43 GMT
  Server: Apache
  Vary: Accept-Encoding
  Content-Encoding: gzip
  Content-Length: 9920
  Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=99
  Connection: Keep-Alive
  Content-Type: text/html
  
  200 OK

===== Mail server =====

We are going to install Postfix as our MTA (SMTP server) and [[http://www.courier-mta.org/|Courier]] as our POP/IMAP server. [[http://www.postfix.org/|Postfix]] will user virtual domains, and information about our domains and users will be stored in the MySQL database. For managing virtual domains and users we will use [[http://postfixadmin.sourceforge.net/|PostfixAdmin]].

For virus scanning and spam protection of our emails we will use [[http://www.clamav.net/|ClamAV]] and [[http://spamassassin.apache.org/|Spamassassin]] that will be run using [[http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/|amavisd-new]].

Note: this tutorial is a combination of tutorials published on http://articles.slicehost.com/email and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostfixCompleteVirtualMailSystemHowto.

You also must have a valid MX record in the DNS zone of your domain pointing to the IP address of the server.

==== Hostname & DNS records ====

Note: Server in this example is named atlantis.example.com. 

First, we need to check our hostname

  atlantis:~# hostname -f
  atlantis.diabmon.com

If hostname did not return FQDN of your server edit ''/etc/hosts''. You should see something like this, if not, change according to your IP address and server name.

  127.0.0.1         localhost
  YOUR-IP-ADDRESS   atlantis.example.com

Now check your ''/etc/hostname'' file:

  atlantis.example.com

Change the names to match your server name and reboot the server. Run ''hostname -f'' again and you should see ''atlantis.example.com''.

Now, we need to check that our DNS servers have an MX record for our example.com domain. Install DNS utilities:

  apt-get install dnsutils

We are going to use ''host'' to check information about our domain:

  atlantis:~# host example.com
  example.com has address YOUR-IP-ADDRESS
  example.com mail is handled by 0 mail.example.com.

We can see, that the mail for our domain is handled by mail.example.com. Now we must make sure that mail.example.com point to the same address as our server (atlantis.example.com).

  atlantis:~# nslookup mail.example.com
  Server:         YOUR-DNS-SERVER
  Address:        YOUR-DNS-ADDRESS#53

  Non-authoritative answer:
  mail.example.com        canonical name = example.com.
  Name:   diabmon.com
  Address: YOUR-IP-ADDRESS

It would be also nice if your reverse DNS points to the same name (atlantis.example.com)

  atlantis:~# nslookup YOUR-IP-ADDRESS
  Server:         YOUR-DNS-SERVER
  Address:        YOUR-DNS-SERVER#53
  
  Non-authoritative answer:
  YOUR-IP-ADDRES-REVERSE.in-addr.arpa      name = atlantis.example.com.

If they do not match. Ask your ISP to change this for you.

==== Plain Postfix ====

If you haven't already installed Postfix, do it now:

  apt-get install postfix telnet mailx

Note: we are also installing telnet so we can easily check if everything is going well during the installation and configuration. As well as mailx package so we can send emails from the terminal using the ''mail'' command.

During installation Postfix will ask you to choose the type of installation and a domain. Choose **Internet site** and enter your servers name **atlantis.example.com**. It is important that your server name is not just **example.com**.

After installation finishes check if Postfix is runing by connecting to port 25 on your localhost with telnet:

  # telnet localhost 25
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  220 diabmon.com ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)

Note: Type **quit** to exit.

If you see Postfix responding, Postfix is working. For another check we can try to send email to one of your other email account:

  mail your-other-email@somedomain.com

  Subject: test email from example.com
  test body of the email.
  .
  Cc:

You should be getting this email message on the account you specified.

Check that you have your ''example.com'' in a file ''/etc/mailname''

Open ''/etc/postfix/main.cf'', it should look something like this:

<file>
# See /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist for a commented, more complete version


# Debian specific:  Specifying a file name will cause the first
# line of that file to be used as the name.  The Debian default
# is /etc/mailname.

smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name (Debian/GNU)
biff = no

mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
inet_interfaces = all
</file>


If your hostname is something like atlantis.example.com and not just example.com you can change ''myorigin = /etc/mailname'' to

  myorigin = $mydomain

and ''mydestination = atlantis.example.com, localhost.example.com, localhost'' to 

  mydestination = $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain, localhost

If your hostname is just example.com doing this will set your origin to just ''.com''. Postfix extract $mydomain from the value of the myhostname and strips the part before the first dot, including the dot.

You can also remove IPV6 notation from the mynetworks and leave just ''mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8''.

Restart Postfix

  invoke-rc.d postfix restart

and try to send another test mail to check that we didn't mess something up.

Now it would be a good time to also test if Postfix is receiving mails as well. Try sending an email to just ''root'' and to ''root@example.com''. The received email should be located in a file ''/var/mail/root''. Check that file and make sure that you are sending email from the right domain (sender should be root@example.com). If you do not receive an email check the Postifx log file ''/var/log/mail.log'' to see what went wrong.

==== Postfix virtual user ====

First we need to create a **vmail** user and group (with ID 5000) on the system. This is a system user who will store all of our email messages.

  groupadd -g 5000 vmail
  useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin -g vmail -u 5000 vmail -d /home/vmail -m

It is important that the vmail user can not login and belongs to vmail group. We are also creating a /home/vmail folder. It is going to hold all of the messages on our mail server.

==== Postfix and MySQL ====

Not, it is time to install some more packages

  apt-get install postfix postfix-mysql mysql-server postfix-tls libsasl2-2 libsasl2-modules libsasl2-modules-sql sasl2-bin libpam-mysql openssl telnet mailx

Do not bother with the packages we already installed, they will be skipped.

As we sad that, we are going to use Postfix Admin for managing the virtual mail users and domains in the MySQL so we need to create database and tables in the MySQL.

Download Postfix Admin using wget. Currently the latest version is 2.3RC3 (check the Postfix Admin site for the latest version).

  cd /root
  wget http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/postfixadmin/postfixadmin_2.3rc3.tar.gz
  tar xvzzf postfixadmin_2.3rc3.tar.gz
  
move the extracted folder to ''/var/www/postfix''

  mv /root/postfixadmin-2.3rc3 /var/www/postfix

Before installing Postfix Admin we must create a database and a user to access the database where we will store all of the information about our domains.

Start MySQL:

  mysql -u root -p

once in MySQL enter

  CREATE DATABASE mail;

Now we need to create a MySQL user that will have privileges to read and edit the mail database (change the ''newpassword'' to something else):

  CREATE USER 'mailadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mail` . * TO 'mailadmin'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

you can exit MySQL now by typing ''exit''.

Open /var/www/postfix/config.inc.php with nano and change setting to:

<file>
 * The following line needs commenting out or removing before the
 * application will run!
 * Doing this implies you have changed this file as required.
 */
$CONF['configured'] = true;


// Postfix Admin Path
// Set the location of your Postfix Admin installation here.
// YOU MUST ENTER THE COMPLETE URL e.g. http://domain.tld/postfixadmin
$CONF['postfix_admin_url'] = 'http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS/postfix';

// shouldn't need changing.
$CONF['postfix_admin_path'] = dirname(__FILE__);

// Language config
// Language files are located in './languages', change as required..
$CONF['default_language'] = 'en';

// Database Config
// mysql = MySQL 3.23 and 4.0, 4.1 or 5
// mysqli = MySQL 4.1+
// pgsql = PostgreSQL
$CONF['database_type'] = 'mysql';
$CONF['database_host'] = 'localhost';
$CONF['database_user'] = 'mailadmin';
$CONF['database_password'] = 'newpassword';
$CONF['database_name'] = 'mail';
$CONF['database_prefix'] = '';
</file>

close the file and open http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS/postfix/setup.php in your browser if everything went well you should be prompted to create the super admin account. Create the account, and after you log in into Postfix Admin create a new virtual domain 'example.com', and create new user accout ''root@example.com''.

Since now we have created our MySQL tables it is time to change some Postfix setting. First we need to create 4 files in the /etc/postfix/ folder:

mysql_virtual_alias_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = alias
select_field = goto
where_field = address
</file>

mysql_virtual_domains_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = domain
select_field = domain
where_field = domain
#additional_conditions = and backupmx = '0' and active = '1'
</file>

mysql_virtual_mailbox_limit_maps.cf
<file>
ser = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
user = postfix
password = postfixpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = postfix
table = mailbox
select_field = quota
where_field = username
#additional_conditions = and active = '1'
</file>

Note: We are not going to use mailbox limits because for this to work we should patch Postfix with a quota patch before installing. Since we are building a server for our personal use I do not really see the need for quotas. If you need them, there are a lot of resources on the internet that explain how to download source packages of Postfix, apply the quota patch and set quota for users.

I am leaving this here, if somebody needs it.

mysql_virtual_mailbox_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = mailbox
select_field = maildir
where_field = username
#additional_conditions = and active = '1'
</file>

Although most of the guides on the net use this file, I do not like it because mailboxes for all virtual domains are saved in /home/vmail/username@domain.com . I like to separate my domain so that every domain has its own folder: ''/home/vmail/domain.com/username''. So we are going to change this file to:

<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = mailbox
query = SELECT CONCAT(domain,'/',SUBSTRING_INDEX(maildir,'@',1),'/') FROM mailbox WHERE username='%s' AND active = 1
</file>

/etc/postfix/mysql_relay_domains_maps.cf
<file>
user = mailadmin
password = newpassword
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = mail
table = domain
select_field = domain
where_field = domain
additional_conditions = and backupmx = '1'
</file>

Since these files contain passwords, we need to protect them:

  atlantis:/etc/postfix# chgrp postfix /etc/postfix/mysql_*.cf
  atlantis:/etc/postfix# chmod 640 /etc/postfix/mysql_*.cf

Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and at the bottom of the file add:

  # Virtual Mailbox Domain Settings
  
  virtual_alias_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql_virtual_alias_maps.cf
  virtual_mailbox_domains = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql_virtual_domains_maps.cf
  virtual_mailbox_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/mysql_virtual_mailbox_maps.cf
  virtual_mailbox_limit = 51200000
  virtual_minimum_uid = 5000
  virtual_uid_maps = static:5000
  virtual_gid_maps = static:5000
  virtual_mailbox_base = /home/vmail
  virtual_transport = virtual

You also need to delete everything after ''mydestination='' directive.

Restart postfix

  invoke-rc.d postfix restart

send email to ''root@example.com''.


  mail root@example.com

  Subject: test email from example.com
  test body of the email.
  .
  Cc:

Check your ''/home/vmail/example.com'' folder. There should be a ''root'' folder inside, with 3 folders inside ''root'' : cur  new  tmp. Inside the folder new you should see your email message. If this didn't work, check ''/var/log/mail.log'' for possible hints on what went wrong.

==== Saslauthd ====

Since we want to allow users to log in to our mail server so they can send emails, we need to configure some kind of protection. First we need to make sure users can log in using the same username and password as the one they will be using for checking email.

For this, we are going to use Saslauthd. We installed it at the beginning of this chapter when we were installing Postfix. Saslauthd will also use MySQL to verify user credentials.

Open ''/etc/default/saslauthd'' with nano and change ''START=no'' to

  START=yes

and at the end of the file we need to change ''OPTIONS="-c -m /var/run/saslauthd"'' to

  OPTIONS="-c -r -m /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd"

We also need to create this directory

  mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd

and one symbolic link (because Postfix on Debian is running from a chrooted environment and other applications you maybe using on your server (including testsaslauthd for testing if saslauthd is working correctly) are not aware of us changing the saslauthd directory).

  ln -s /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd /var/run/saslauthd
 
We also need to create two more files:

  nano /etc/pam.d/smtp

<file>
auth    required   pam_mysql.so user=mailadmin passwd=newpassword host=127.0.0.1 db=mail table=mailbox usercolumn=username passwdcolumn=password crypt=1
account sufficient pam_mysql.so user=mailadmin passwd=newpassword host=127.0.0.1 db=mail table=mailbox usercolumn=username passwdcolumn=password crypt=1
</file>

  nano /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf

<file>
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
mech_list: plain login
allow_plaintext: true
auxprop_plugin: mysql
sql_hostnames: 127.0.0.1
sql_user: mailadmin
sql_passwd: newpassword
sql_database: mail
sql_select: select password from mailbox where username = '%u'
</file>

We need to add Postfix to the sasl group so it can access the saslauthd process we just setup:

  adduser postfix sasl

Restart Postfix and sasl

  /etc/init.d/postfix restart
  /etc/init.d/saslauthd restart

Now, we can check is saslauthd is working correctly

  testsaslauthd -s smtp -u root@example.com -p newpassword

Ofcourse, replace root@example.com with the mail account you have created with Postfix Admin, and newpassword with the password you have set for this user.

  atlantis:~# testsaslauthd -s smtp -u root@example.com -p newpassword
  0: OK "Success."

If you do not get "Success." as a response, check that you have a symbolic link in /var/run/ named saslauthd and that it points to ''/var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslautdh''.

We have to change permissions to these two files as well:

  chgrp sasl /etc/pam.d/smtp
  chmod 640 /etc/pam.d/smtp
  chgrp postfix /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
  chmod 640 /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf

Restart Postfix and sasl

  /etc/init.d/postfix restart
  /etc/init.d/saslauthd restart

==== TLS ====

Now, we are going to configure Postfix to use TLS. If you still haven't created a self signed certificates do it now.

Edit ''/etc/postfix/main.cf'' and look for the part containing:

<file>
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
smtpd_use_tls=yes
smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
</file>

and replace it with

<file>
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes
smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header = yes
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, reject_unauth_destination
smtpd_use_tls = yes
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/self-signed/server.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file = $smtpd_tls_cert_file
</file>

Note: ''/etc/ssl/self-signed/server.pem'' should point to the location of your .pem file.

We are telling Postfix that we want to allow sending emails without authentication for our networks (localhost) and for users that authenticated using sasl we configured previously.

Restart Postfix and try to send an email user your email client from your workstation. You will not be able to read emails yet. Just make sure for username you are using the your email address, that you selected to use authentication for your SMTP server and that TLS is selected. (Note: change the firewall rules before).

==== Enable submission port ====

Many ISPs today block port 25 for users. To be able to send email using our Postfix mail server as our outgoing server, we need to enable submission port (port 587) for Postfix.

Open ''/etc/postfix/master.cf'' and uncomment the folloging lines:

<file>
submission inet n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
  -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt
  -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
  -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_sasl_authenticated,reject
  -o milter_macro_daemon_name=ORIGINATING
</file>

Note: spaces in the lines after the first line are important. Do not delete them!

==== Postfix firewall rules ====

You have to change Firewall rules to allow inbound connections to ports that Postfix uses:

  * Port 25 for incoming mail from other mail servers and from clients (if they can use this port)
  * Submission port 587 for incoming mail from users

==== Courier ====

To install Courier with support for MySQL authorisation and POP3, POP3-SSL, IMAP and IMAP-SSL access to mailboxes you can run:

  apt-get install courier-authdaemon courier-authlib-mysql courier-pop courier-pop-ssl courier-imap courier-imap-ssl

Since I do not use POP3 I am only installing

  apt-get install courier-authdaemon courier-authlib-mysql courier-imap courier-imap-ssl

When asked if you would like to create directories for web-based administration, answer **No**.

Open ''/etc/courier/authdaemonrc'' and change

  authmodulelist="authpam"
to
  authmodulelist="authmysql"

Create a backup of the ''/etc/courier/authmysqlrc'' file

  cd /etc/courier/
  cp authmysqlrc authmysqlrc~

Empty ''/etc/courier/authmysqlrc''

  cat /dev/null > /etc/courier/authmysqlrc
  nano /etc/courier/authmysqlrc

And paste the following:

<file>
MYSQL_SERVER localhost
MYSQL_USERNAME mailadmin
MYSQL_PASSWORD newpassword
MYSQL_PORT 0
MYSQL_DATABASE mail
MYSQL_USER_TABLE mailbox
MYSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD password
MYSQL_UID_FIELD 5000
MYSQL_GID_FIELD 5000
MYSQL_LOGIN_FIELD username
MYSQL_HOME_FIELD "/home/vmail"
MYSQL_MAILDIR_FIELD CONCAT(SUBSTRING_INDEX(username,'@',-1),'/',SUBSTRING_INDEX(username,'@',1),'/')
</file>

==== Configure Courier to user our certificates ====

  nano /etc/courier/imapd-ssl

and change values of TLS_CERTFILE and TLS_TRUSTCERTS to

  TLS_CERTFILE=/etc/ssl/self-signed/server.pem
  TLS_TRUSTCERTS=/etc/ssl/self-signed/server.crt

To restart Courier you have to restart couple of services

  /etc/init.d/courier-authdaemon restart
  /etc/init.d/courier-imap restart
  /etc/init.d/courier-imap-ssl restart

And if you have installed POP3 as well

  /etc/init.d/courier-pop restart
  /etc/init.d/courier-pop-ssl restart

==== Courier firewall rules ====

You have to change Firewall rules to allow inbound connections to ports that Courier uses:

  * Pop and secure Pop use ports 110 and 995 respectively.
  * Imap and secure imap use ports 143 and 993 respectively.

==== Fighting spam and viruses ====

This part is taken from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostfixAmavisNew

Install Amavis, Clamav and SpamAssassin

  apt-get install amavisd-new spamassassin clamav-daemon

Note: libnet-dns-perl libmail-spf-query-perl pyzor razor are installed as dependencies.

Add **contrib** and **non-free** repositories by editing ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' and append " contrib non-free" on every line that starts with deb, and ends with main. You should be looking at something like this:

<file>
# deb http://ftp.carnet.hr/debian/ lenny main

deb http://ftp.carnet.hr/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.carnet.hr/debian/ lenny main

deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main

deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main contrib non-free
deb-src http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
</file>

After editing ''sources.list'' run

  apt-get update

Now, we can install utilities for compression and decompression of archives

  apt-get install arj bzip2 cabextract cpio file gzip lha nomarch pax rar unrar unzip zip zoo

Add clamav user to the amavis group and vice versa in order for Clamav to have access to scan files:

  adduser clamav amavis
  adduser amavis clamav

Enable SpamAssassin by editing ''/etc/default/spamassassin'' and setting

  ENABLED=1

and start SpamAssassin with

  invoke-rc.d spamassassin start

Edit ''/etc/amavis/conf.d/15-content_filter_mode'' and ucomment antivirus and spam checking

<file>
use strict;

# You can modify this file to re-enable SPAM checking through spamassassin
# and to re-enable antivirus checking.

#
# Default antivirus checking mode
# Uncomment the two lines below to enable it back
#

@bypass_virus_checks_maps = (
   \%bypass_virus_checks, \@bypass_virus_checks_acl, \$bypass_virus_checks_re);


#
# Default SPAM checking mode
# Uncomment the two lines below to enable it back
#

@bypass_spam_checks_maps = (
   \%bypass_spam_checks, \@bypass_spam_checks_acl, \$bypass_spam_checks_re);

1;  # ensure a defined return
</file>

Bouncing spam can be a bad idea as the return address is often faked, so it may have your server put on a blacklist. Edit /etc/amavis/conf.d/20-debian_defaults and change:

  $final_spam_destiny       = D_PASS;

Bouncing spam is not a good idea. I suggest you also change default spam levels and lover them at a later time if you start getting to much spam:

  $sa_spam_subject_tag = '***SPAM*** ';
  $sa_tag_level_deflt  = 6.0;  # add spam info headers if at, or above that level
  $sa_tag2_level_deflt = 10; # add 'spam detected' headers at that level
  $sa_kill_level_deflt = 10; # triggers spam evasive actions
  $sa_dsn_cutoff_level = 10;   # spam level beyond which a DSN is not sent

Configuring other options (including SpamAssasing are currently out of scope for this document).

Change the permissions on ''/var/lib/amavis/tmp''

  chmod -R 775 /var/lib/amavis/tmp

After configuration Amavis needs to be restarted:

sudo /etc/init.d/amavis restart

To integrate Amavis with Postfix we need to add the ''content_filter'' in ''/etc/postfix/main.cf''

  content_filter = smtp-amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024


Open ''/etc/postfix/master.cf'' and add this at the end of the file:

<file>
smtp-amavis     unix    -       -       -       -       2       smtp
        -o smtp_data_done_timeout=1200
        -o smtp_send_xforward_command=yes
        -o disable_dns_lookups=yes
        -o max_use=20

127.0.0.1:10025 inet    n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
        -o content_filter=
        -o local_recipient_maps=
        -o relay_recipient_maps=
        -o smtpd_restriction_classes=
        -o smtpd_delay_reject=no
        -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
        -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
        -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
        -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
        -o smtpd_data_restrictions=reject_unauth_pipelining
        -o smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions=
        -o mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8
        -o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
        -o smtpd_soft_error_limit=1001
        -o smtpd_hard_error_limit=1000
        -o smtpd_client_connection_count_limit=0
        -o smtpd_client_connection_rate_limit=0
        -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks,no_unknown_recipient_checks
</file>

and add this immediately below the "pickup" transport service:

         -o content_filter=
         -o receive_override_options=no_header_body_checks

This will prevent messages that are generated to report on spam from being classified as spam. 

Restart Postfix:

  /etc/init.d/postfix restart
